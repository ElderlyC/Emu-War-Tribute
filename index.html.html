  <h2>The War</h2>

  <h3>First Attempt</h3>
  <p class="quote">"The machine-gunners' dreams of point blank fire into serried masses of Emus were soon dissipated. The Emu command had evidently ordered guerrilla tactics, and its unwieldy army soon split up into innumerable small units that made use of the military equipment uneconomic. A crestfallen field force therefore withdrew from the combat area after about a month."</p>
  <div></div>
  <h3>Second Attempt</h3>
  <p>After the withdrawal of the military, the emu attacks on crops continued. Farmers again asked for support, citing the hot weather and drought that brought emus invading farms in the thousands. James Mitchell, the Premier of Western Australia lent his strong support to renewal of the military assistance. At the same time, a report from the Base Commander was issued that indicated <strong>300</strong> emus had been killed in the initial operation.</p>

  <h3>The Unstoppable Enemy</h3>
  <p class="quote">If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying capacity of these birds it would face any army in the world ... They can face machine guns with the invulnerability of tanks. They are like Zulus whom even dum-dum bullets could not stop. - Some guy</p>
